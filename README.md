# 2048 Game

A classic 2048 puzzle game built for the web. Combine tiles with the same numbers to reach the elusive 2048 tile. Built with a focus on smooth gameplay, responsive design, and simple, intuitive controls.

I believe that games should be interesting, exciting, and accessible â€” without unnecessary details, without distractions, just pure puzzle enjoyment.

Challenge yourself and enjoy the addictive sliding puzzle experience.
